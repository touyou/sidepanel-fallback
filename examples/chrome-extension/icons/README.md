# Chrome Extension Icons

This directory contains icons for the Chrome Extension example.

For demonstration purposes, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG icons.

Here's a sample icon set you can create or download:

## Required Icons:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Simple Icon Creation:

You can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor or online tools
like:

- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://iconifier.net/
- Or use any existing üéõÔ∏è icon/emoji as a base

The current extension works without icons, but adding them improves the user
experience.
